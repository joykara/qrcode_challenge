## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### Continued development

The areas I want to continue focusing on in future projects include:
- Dealing with the styling of my margins and padding
- Refining my code lines too.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26665324/center-div-with-padding-instead-of-margin) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to center my margins and padding. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
